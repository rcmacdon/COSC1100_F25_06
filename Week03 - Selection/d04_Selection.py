#  PRACTICE EXERCISE
# 1 - redo the C to F converter, where the user enters the temperature followed by a c or an f, and the program converts it to the other one.

# 2 - make a calendar reminder....
# have the user type in the day of the week, and the program will tell the user what they are doing that day!  (Make it up)  Do not limit the user to typing a specific case!
