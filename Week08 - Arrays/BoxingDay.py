# Purpose:      To design an array implementation system
# -------------------------------------

# as a small group/partners, design a quick and dirty data storage system to keep track of the queue status and the time for you to show up rather than waiting in line.

# enough information about a single person for ID
# first name, last name, phone#
# time of day day, order in which they applied
first_name = []
last_name = []
phone = []
time_showup = []
franchise_location = []
